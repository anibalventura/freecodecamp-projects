        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure
        a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
        within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
        and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a
        basic understanding of HTML and its functions.
      </p>

    <section id="So_What_Is_HTML?" class="main-section">
      <header>So What Is HTML?</header>
      <p>
        HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that
        defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
        elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the
        content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The
        enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else,
        can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
        For example, take the following line of content:
      </p>
      <code>My cat is very grumpy.</code>
      <p>
        If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
        a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
      </p>
      <code><span><</span><span>p></span>My cat is very grumpy.<span><</span><span>/p></span></code>
    </section>

    <section id="Anatomy_Of_An_HTML_Element" class="main-section">
      <header>Anatomy Of An HTML Element</header>
      <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this
          case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states
          where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case
          where the paragraph begins.
        </li>
        <li>
          The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it
          includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where
          the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to
          add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can
          lead to strange results.
        </li>
        <li>
          The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case,
          is just text.
        </li>
        <li>
          The element: The opening tag, the closing tag and the content
          together comprise the element.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="Attributes" class="main-section">
      <header>Attributes</header>
      <p>
        Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't
        want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute
        name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute
        allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to
        target the element with style information and other things.
      </p>
      <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute,
          if the element already has one or more Attributes).
        </li>
        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
        <li>
          The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section id="Nesting_Elements" class="main-section">
      <header>Nesting Elements</header>
      <p>
        You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called
        nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could
        wrap the word "very" in a <span>
          <</span><span>strong></span> element, which means that the word is to be strongly
        emphasized:
      </p>
      <code>
          <span><</span><span>p></span>My cat is <span><</span><span>strong></span>very<span><</span></span><span>/strong></span> grumpy.<span><</span><span>/p></span>
        </code>
      <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested. In the example above, we opened the
        <span>
          <</span> <span>p>
        </span> element first, then the <span>
          <</span> <span>strong>
        </span> element; therefore, we have to close the <span>
          <</span> <span>strong>
        </span> element first, then the <span>
          <</span> <span>p>
        </span> element. The following is incorrect:</p>
      <code>
        <span><</span><span>p></span>My cat is <span><</span><span>strong></span>very grumpy.<span><</span></span><span>/p></span></span><span><</span><span>/strong></span>  
      </code>
      <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they
        overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to say,
        which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>

    <section id="Empty_Elements" class="main-section">
      <header>Empty Elements</header>
      <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty Elements. Take the <span>
          <</span> <span>img
        </span><span>></span> element that we already have in our HTML page:</p>
      <code><span><</span><span>img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></span></code>
      <p>This contains two Attributes, but there is no closing <span>
          <</span><span>/</span><span>img></span> tag and no inner content. This is because an image element doesn't
            wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
