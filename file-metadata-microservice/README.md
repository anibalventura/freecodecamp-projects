# File Metadata Microservice API

See live page [here](https://filemetadatamicroservice-av.herokuapp.com/)

### User stories:

1. I can submit a form that includes a file upload.
2. The form file input field has the "name" attribute set to "upfile". We rely on this in testing.
3. When I submit something, I will receive the file name and size in bytes within the JSON response

### Usage :

- Go to the main page, and upload a file using the provided form.
