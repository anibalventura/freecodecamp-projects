Practice Questions.

1. What is []?

Are brakets used to store the values of a list.



2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)

spam = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
spam[2] = 'hello'



*** For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].

3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)] evaluate to?

spam = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]

evaluates to = 3

'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 3



4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?

Evaluates to 'd'



5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?

Evaluates to 'a', 'b'



*** For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].

6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?

bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

evaluates to 1



7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?

bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99



8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?

bacon = [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]

3.14, 'cat', 11, True



9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?

+= and *=



10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?

append() put the value to the end of the list
insert() put a value in a specifict index of the list



11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?

del and list.remove()



12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.

Both lists and strings can be passed to len(), have indexes and slices, be used in for loops, be concatenated or replicated, and be used with the in and not in operators



13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?

list are mutable and tuples are inmutable




14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?

tuple = ((42,))



15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?

The tuple() and list() functions, respectively



16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly.
What do they contain instead?

The contain references in Python of the list



17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?

copy.copy() creates a copy of a list
copy.deepcopy() creates a duplicate of the list
