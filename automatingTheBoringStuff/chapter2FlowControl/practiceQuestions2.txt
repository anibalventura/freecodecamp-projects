Practice Questions.

1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

The two values are: True and False (Whit the first letter in capitalcase and the following in lowercase).



2. What are the three Boolean operators?

The three operators are: and, or, and not.



3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

****** and ******
True and True     =     True
True and False    =     False
False and False   =     False
False and True    =     False


****** or ******
True or True     =     True
True or False    =     True
False or False   =     False
False or True    =     True


****** not ******
not True    =     False
not False    =    True



4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)                    False
not (5 > 4)                             False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)                     True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))               False
(True and True) and (True == False)     False
(not False) or (not True)               True



5. What are the six comparison operators?

==
!=
<
>
<=
>=



6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

The equal to operator evaluates if two values are the same and the assigment operator evaluate the result of the variable right to left.



7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.




8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
*************************
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
*************************
    print('spam')
print('spam')



9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = int(input('Enter 1 to print "Hello", 2 to print "Howdy": '))

if spam == 1:
  print ('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
  print ('Howdy')
else:
  print('Greetings!')



10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

In the keyboard press: Ctrl + C



11. What is the difference between break and continue?

break: terminate the while loop when the block of code evaluates to True.

continue: jump to the beginning of the while loop if the block of code evaluates to False.



12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

range(10): evaluates all values to complete the integer.

range(0,10): evaluates all values between the tow integer, but not the second.

range(0, 10, 1): evaluates all values between the first two integer and the third indicates the steps of the values.



13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

# Using for loop.
num = 1

for num in range(1,11):
  print (num)


# Using while loop.
num = 1

while num < 11:
  print(num)
  num = num + 1



14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

spam.bacon()
