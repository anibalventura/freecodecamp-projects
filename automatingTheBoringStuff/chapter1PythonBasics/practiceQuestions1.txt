Chapter 1 - Practice Questions.

1. Which of the following are operators, and which are values?

*           (Operator)
'hello'     (Value)
-88.8       (Value)
-           (Operator)
/           (Operator)
+           (Operator)
5           (Value)



2. Which of the following is a variable, and which is a string?

spam         (Variable)
'spam'       (String)



3. Name three data types.

Strings, floating-point numbers, integers.



4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

Expressions consist of values (such as 2) and operators (such as +), and they can always evaluate (that is, reduce) down to a single value.



5. This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

An expression evaluates to a single value. A statement does not.



6. What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?

bacon = 20
bacon + 1

The bacon variable is set to 20. The bacon + 1 expression does not reassign the value in bacon (that would need an assignment statement: bacon = bacon + 1).


7. What should the following two expressions evaluate to?

'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3

They evaluate to    spamspmapsma



8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

Because "100" started with a number and variables cant start with numbers.



9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

int()
float()
str()



10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it? 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

Causes an error because python cant concatenate a string with an integer, first the integer must be convert to a string: 'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
